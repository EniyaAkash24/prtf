## üÜò Troubleshooting

### If Something Breaks:

1. **Check for syntax errors:**
   - Missing commas between array items
   - Unmatched quotes or brackets
   - Missing closing braces

2. **Common mistakes:**

   // WRONG - missing comma
   skills: ["React", "TypeScript" "Node.js"]

   ```

3. **Save and refresh** - Sometimes you just need to save the file and refresh your browser

4. **Check the console** - Open browser dev tools (F12) to see error messages

### Error Messages You Might See:
- `Unexpected token` - Usually missing comma or quote
- `Unexpected end of input` - Missing closing brace or bracket
- `Cannot read property of undefined` - Missing required field
